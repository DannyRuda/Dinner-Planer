one module for each menu point
    Home
    generate dish     
    all Dishes
    add Dishes

each module needs to export a function that "loads the content on the page" meaning
creating and adding the html elements to the DOM.

    Home
        export .....
        function loadpage{
            create and add html elements to DOM
        }
        
    generate dish
        export .....

        create and add html elements to DOM

        show random dish
            logic:
                create button element and add event handler
                get random element from dishes array

            DOMstuff:
                show recipe card
                    add elements of recipe card to DOM
                    set values of elements corresponding to the dish element/object
                change text in the generate dish button
        
        show another random dish
            logic:
                get new random element from dishes array thats not the old one
            
            DOMstuff:
                change values of recipe card elements corresponding to new element
    
    All Dishes
        export .....

        create and add html elements to DOM
            logic:

                    form validation
                    stop form from reloading the page
                    fetch the entered data from the form input fields
                    create object with the data fetched from the form
                    add object to the array
    
    index.js 
        import ....

                    create elements for menu points and add event handlers calling the function that the modules export
                
                DOMstuff:

            logic:
                add event handler to menu point elements
                    home.addevent click removeElements
                    home.addevent click loadpage
                    home.addevent click removeclass former active
