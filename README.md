## Short Description
----
This Website is not finished yet and there are alot of things that will be improved or added later on, especially the visuals. See the List of planed improvements. The Website still can help you overcome the struggle of figuring out what to eat for Dinner. On This Website you can add recipes to the collection, view all recipes in the collection and let the website show you a random dish from the collection. If you dont know what to eat for dinner, you simply let the website show you a random dish from the collection with the necessary ingredients and you make that recipe for dinner.
